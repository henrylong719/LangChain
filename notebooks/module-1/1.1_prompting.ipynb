      "- Location: perched on the rim of Shackleton Crater, near the lunar south pole, where near-constant sunlight can be captured by colossal solar arrays and a shielded shielded zone protects from micrometeoroids and radiation.\n",
      "- Appearance: a city of glassy towers and basalt-brick districts, braided with light-gold transit corridors. Subterranean rings shielded from the harsh surface climate hold government halls, archives, and research labs.\n",
      "- Government and society: the Lunar Assembly governs from the Beacon Palace, a crystal-etched dome at the crater’s edge. A Council of the Rim represents distant colonies, while a technocratic core runs the orbital and surface infrastructure. Citizens are issued lunar passes and participate in regular referenda on major policy.\n",
      "- Economy: powered largely by solar harvesting, water ice extraction from the crater floor, and 3D-printed manufacturing. Lunar science and tourism (to see glow-lit regolith mines and the eternal sunrise views) are important sectors.\n",
      "- Transport: a network of magnetic-lev tramways, elevator spines up the crater rim, and subterranean transit tunnels linking districts. Drones handle heavy logistics and patrol the perimeter.\n",
      "- Notable districts:\n",
      "  - The Beacon District: government and ceremonial spaces, where the central spire houses the executive chamber.\n",
      "  - The Archive Ring: a vault of lunar exploration data, habitat records, and holographic museums.\n",
      "  - The Glass Quarter: residential towers with public viewing galleries of the cosmos.\n",
      "  - The Ice Market: commerce hub dealing in water ice, regolith bricks, and planetary-grade simulants.\n",
      "- Culture and vibe: a blend of stoic engineering ethos and luminous art. Evenings feature the Festival of First Light, when streets glow with bioluminescent flora and sky-screens project constellations from Earth’s myths reimagined in lunar syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’d like, I can also rename Lunaris Prime or give it a short scene set there to show life in the capital. Would you prefer a grittier frontier capital, or a more ceremonial, gleaming metropolis?\n"
